1
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:44,102
不，不要……

00:00:44,103 --> 00:00:46,520
不，不要……

3
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:50,951
不要啊！

4
00:00:50,952 --> 00:00:58,189
宇宙洗衣房

5
00:02:20,084 --> 00:02:21,984
Excuse me?

Excuse me, sir? 
打扰一下好吗，先生？

Do you have a moment, sir?

Yes? Thank you.

My name is Victor.

You are Franck.

00:03:00,404 --> 00:03:03,966
You are so much more than just a sheep, aren't you?
一张羊皮岂能容下你的伟大灵魂，对吧？

Oh yeah? How would you know?

Just like me, you're... a lone wolf.
你和我一样，就像是一匹孤狼

21
00:03:18,562 --> 00:03:22,266
Tell me, does one choose to be alone?
你说说看，有谁会甘心寂寞吗？

22
00:03:22,894 --> 00:03:24,
No, one doesn't.
没人会的

23
00:03:25,134 --> 00:03:27,656
One doesn’t even choose to be a wolf.
人们甚至连狼都不想做

24
00:03:29,898 --> 00:03:31,082
Or does one?

Well, mister... err... Hector.

Victor. Victor.

I don’t know what you’re on about
我不知道你想干什么

28
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,440
but I'm just 
a sheep minding its own business.
但是呢，本羊从不管别人的事

29
00:03:46,578 --> 00:03:49,347
And I suggest you do the same.

30
00:03:49,348 --> 00:03:51,740
No. No no no, Franck. Wait wait wait.

31
00:03:51,741 --> 00:03:54,528
No. This is not... the way.

00:03:54,529 --> 00:03:57,479
Just give me one minute of your precious time.

Yeah just give me one minute.

You would have one more minute, wouldn't you?

39
00:04:25,396 --> 00:04:27,357
I knew it.
我就知道

40
00:04:27,358 --> 00:04:29,397
I knew it.
我就知道

41
00:04:30,276 --> 00:04:32,631

这个小装置全都能搞定，而且绝对干净

48
00:04:57,043 --> 00:05:00,424
Well this... this better be good.
好吧，最好管用

49
00:05:01,212 --> 00:05:04,185
Took me ages to tie that rope.
我花了很久才系上那根绳子

50
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:07,200
With my fucking hooves.

Wait wait wait wait wait wait.

How does this thing work?

I mean, how do I make it work?

00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:42,004
Hey!
