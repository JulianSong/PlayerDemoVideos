1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,146
At the left we can see...


2
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:20,099
At the right we can see the...


3
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:21,979
...the head-snarlers


4
00:00:21,999 --> 00:00:24,562
Everything is safe. Perfectly safe.
 

5
00:00:24,582 --> 00:00:28,035
Emo?
Emo

6
00:00:28,206 --> 00:00:30,996
Watch out!


7
00:00:47,037 --> 00:00:49,494
Are you hurt?


8
00:00:51,994 --> 00:00:55,140
I don't think so. You?


9
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,098
I'm Ok.


10
00:00:57,118 --> 00:01:02,014
Get up. Emo, it's not safe here.


11
00:01:02,034 --> 00:01:03,590
Let's go.


12
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,180
What's next?


13
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,146
You'll see!


14
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:20,022
Emo. This way.
Emo 

15
00:01:34,237 --> 00:01:36,481
Follow me!


16
00:02:11,106 --> 00:02:13,480
Hurry Emo!


17
00:02:48,059 --> 00:02:50,122
You're not paying attention!


18
00:02:50,142 --> 00:02:54,954
I just want to answer the... ...phone.
 

19
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:59,120
Emo, look, I mean listen.
emo

20
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,008
You have to learn to listen.


21
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,036
This is not some game.


22
00:03:05,056 --> 00:03:09,994
You, I mean we, we could easily die out here.


23
00:03:10,014 --> 00:03:15,959
Listen, listen to the sounds of the machine.
 

24
00:03:18,054 --> 00:03:21,009
Listen to your breathing.


25
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:29,064
Well, don't you ever get tired of this?


26
00:04:29,084 --> 00:04:31,106
Tired?!?


27
00:04:31,126 --> 00:04:35,063
Emo, the machine is like clockwork.
Emo

28
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,146
One move out of place...


29
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:40,121
...and you're ground to a pulp.


30
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,021
But isn't it -


31
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:47,020
Pulp, Emo! Is that what you want, pulp?
emo 

32
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,995
Emo, your goal in life...


33
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,953
...pulp?


34
00:05:41,156 --> 00:05:44,028
Emo, close your eyes.
Emo

35
00:05:44,156 --> 00:05:48,027
Why? - Now!
 - 

36
00:05:51,155 --> 00:05:53,102
Ok.


37
00:05:53,113 --> 00:05:55,688
Good.


38
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:03,103
What do you see at your left side, Emo?
Emo

39
00:06:04,028 --> 00:06:06,007
Nothing. - Really?
 - 

40
00:06:06,027 --> 00:06:07,924
No, nothing at all.


41
00:06:07,944 --> 00:06:13,131
And at your right, what do you see at your right side, Emo?
 Emo

42
00:06:13,151 --> 00:06:16,922
The same Proog, exactly the same...
proog

43
00:06:16,942 --> 00:06:21,098
...nothing! - Great.
 - 

44
00:06:40,105 --> 00:06:43,085
Listen Proog! Do you hear that!
proog

45
00:06:43,105 --> 00:06:44,959
Can we go here?


46
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:49,125
There? It isn't safe, Emo.
Emo

47
00:06:49,145 --> 00:06:53,000
But... - Trust me, it's not.
 - 

48
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,161
Maybe I could...


49
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:56,969
No.


50
00:06:57,102 --> 00:07:00,124
NO!


51
00:07:00,144 --> 00:07:03,956
Any further questions, Emo?
Emo

52
00:07:03,976 --> 00:07:06,090
No.


53
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:11,089
Emo?
Emo

54
00:07:11,142 --> 00:07:13,075
Emo, why...
Emo

55
00:07:13,095 --> 00:07:14,038
Emo...
Emo

56
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:18,121
...why can't you see the beauty of this place?
 

57
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:20,120
The way it works.


58
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,912
How perfect it is.


59
00:07:23,932 --> 00:07:27,036
No, Proog, I don't see.
Proog

60
00:07:27,056 --> 00:07:30,970
I don't see because there's nothing there.


61
00:07:31,055 --> 00:07:35,035
And why should I trust my life to something that isn't there?


62
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:37,034
Well can you tell me that?


63
00:07:37,054 --> 00:07:39,926
Answer me!


64
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,000
Proog...
Proog

65
00:07:45,053 --> 00:07:47,002
...you're a sick man!


66
00:07:47,022 --> 00:07:49,918
Stay away from me!


67
00:07:52,052 --> 00:07:55,115
No! Emo! It's a trap!
Emo

68
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,948
Hah, it's a trap.


69
00:07:56,968 --> 00:08:01,947
At the left side you can see the hanging gardens of Babylon!
 

70
00:08:01,967 --> 00:08:04,957
How's that for a trap?


71
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,922
No, Emo.
Emo

72
00:08:09,008 --> 00:08:12,904
At the right side you can see... ...well guess what...
 

73
00:08:12,924 --> 00:08:15,112
...the colossus of Rhodes!


74
00:08:15,132 --> 00:08:16,070
No!


75
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:23,919
The colossus of Rhodes and it is here just for you Proog.
 Proog.

76
00:08:51,001 --> 00:08:52,939
It is there...


77
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:58,040
I'm telling you, Emo...
Emo

78
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:10,040
